Interfaces:
are a contract.  Allowed includes all definitions...
method signatures
CONSTANTS

//  create a parent class
//  extend the parent with a child class
//  provide no default constructors in the parent or child
//  explore these ...

So, provide a parent class, extend with a child class.
Override a method with the Child.
attempt to directly access the parent methods from within the parent and it will call the child overridden method.
However, in the child, call super to explicitly execute the inherited original version of the method.
